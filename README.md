# practice arithmetic in the terminal

I made this for my kid to practice getting faster at basic arithmetic.

# features

* generate random questions, within a number range
* … randomly either × or ÷ for now
* ensure that question hasn't already been given in this session
* time how long it takes to answer
* save the question, correct answer, given answer, and time taken
* after the quiz is done, show the wrong answers
* in the next quiz, ask the wrong answers from the previous quiz
* also in the next quiz, ask the questions that took the longest to answer

More to come.
